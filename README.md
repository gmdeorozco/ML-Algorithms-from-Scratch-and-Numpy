# ML Algorithms from Scratch and Numpy

Welcome to the ML Algorithms from Scratch and Numpy repository!

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning algorithms both from scratch and utilizing the powerful numerical computing library, NumPy. The goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the inner workings of fundamental ML techniques and optimize code for efficiency using NumPy's capabilities.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Neural Networks (Single Layer Perceptron and Multi-Layer Perceptron)
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Gradient Descent Optimization Algorithms
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- And more!

## Code Quality and Documentation

Each algorithm's implementation is well-documented, accompanied by detailed explanations and comments. This ensures ease of understanding, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced practitioners.

## Example Datasets

To facilitate experimentation, we've included example datasets that you can use to run the algorithms and observe their performance. This allows you to compare outcomes, gaining practical insights into algorithm strengths and weaknesses.

## Contributions

Contributions from the open-source community are highly encouraged! If you find a bug, have optimization suggestions, or wish to add new algorithms, feel free to submit pull requests. Together, let's learn and grow in the fascinating world of Machine Learning!
